# Simulations code for NNT, NNE & EIN estimation

Simulations and data analysis code for the paper Estimation of the Number Needed to Treat, the Number Needed to Expose, and the Exposure Impact Number with Instrumental Variables by Valentin Vancak & Arvid Sjölander. 
The repository consists of three folders: logit model simulation - code for the simulation of the double logistic model. Probit model simulation - code for the simulation of the double probit model. Vitamin D - code for the Vitamin D data example.
The logit and probit models folders contain five files each: (1) G-estimators functions. (2) Probability & Indices functions. (3) Sandwich formula for the covariance matrix. (4) Main simulation file. (5) Plots generating code.
The Vitamin D file contains two files with (1) double logit model analysis and (2) double probit model analysis.
